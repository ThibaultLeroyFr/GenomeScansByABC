Note that given the specifications of github, the file "BAN_4especes_PipelineBowtie2.pileup.sync.freqSNP_rc_biallelic_sites_counts.hefst.out.outliers.withpositions" is by several order of magnitude too large to be upload on github (full file >7Gb). 
This file therefore only contains the first 200,000 SNPs found in the oak genome for the Q.robur-Q.petraea pair, here provided as an example

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions concerning this file
